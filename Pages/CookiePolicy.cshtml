<h1>Cookie Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 29/11/2025</p>

<h2>1. What are cookies?</h2>
<p>
    Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device when you visit a website. 
    They are widely used to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information 
    to the site owners.
</p>

<h2>2. How QuickToolbox uses cookies</h2>
<p>
    QuickToolbox uses a small number of cookies to remember your preferences and, if you consent, to collect 
    anonymous analytics data and show advertising.
</p>
<p>
    We group cookies into two categories:
</p>

<h3>2.1 Essential cookies</h3>
<p>
    These cookies are required for the website to function correctly. They do not store personally 
    identifiable information.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Cookie consent preference</strong>  
        Used to remember whether you accepted or rejected optional cookies, so we do not show the 
        cookie banner on every visit.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Because these cookies are necessary for the operation of the site, they cannot be disabled via the cookie banner.
</p>

<h3>2.2 Optional cookies</h3>
<p>
    Optional cookies are only used if you click <em>“Accept”</em> on the cookie banner. If you click 
    <em>“Reject”</em>, these cookies are not set.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Analytics cookies (Google Analytics)</strong><br />
        Used to collect anonymous information about how visitors use the website, such as which pages are visited 
        and how long users spend on them. This helps us improve the tools and overall user experience.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Advertising cookies (Google AdSense, if enabled)</strong><br />
        Used to display adverts and measure their performance. Where enabled, these cookies may be used to show 
        more relevant ads based on your interests if you consent to personalised advertising.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Optional cookies will <strong>not</strong> be loaded unless you give explicit consent via the cookie banner.
</p>

<h2>3. Managing your cookie preferences</h2>
<p>
    When you first visit QuickToolbox, you will see a cookie banner that allows you to accept or reject 
    optional cookies.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Accept</strong> – we will enable analytics/advertising cookies.</li>
    <li><strong>Reject</strong> – we will not load analytics/advertising cookies.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    You can change your choice at any time by using the 
    <a href="#" onclick="localStorage.removeItem('qt-cookie-consent'); location.reload();">
        Change cookie settings
    </a>
    link in the footer. This will clear your previous choice and show the cookie banner again.
</p>

<h2>4. Third-party cookies</h2>
<p>
    Where optional cookies are enabled, they may be set by trusted third-party providers such as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Google Analytics</li>
    <li>Google AdSense (if advertising is enabled)</li>
</ul>
<p>
    These providers may use their own cookies to perform analytics or deliver adverts. For more information on how 
    they handle data, please refer to their privacy and cookie policies:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/cookies" target="_blank">Google Cookies</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Browser-level cookie controls</h2>
<p>
    Most web browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings, including blocking or deleting cookies. 
    However, disabling cookies completely may affect how some websites function.
</p>
<p>
    You can usually find cookie settings in the <em>Options</em>, <em>Settings</em> or <em>Preferences</em> menu of your browser.
</p>

<h2>6. Changes to this Cookie Policy</h2>
<p>
    We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the law or in how we use cookies. 
    Any updates will be posted on this page with a revised “Last updated” date.
</p>

<h2>7. Contact</h2>
