<h1>Cookie Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 09/12/2025</p>

<h2>1. What are cookies?</h2>
<p>
    Cookies are small text files that are placed on your device when you visit a website.
    They help websites operate correctly, improve performance, and provide information to site owners.
    Some cookies are essential, while others are optional and used for analytics or advertising.
</p>

<h2>2. How QuickToolkit uses cookies</h2>
<p>
    QuickToolkit uses a limited number of cookies to remember your preferences and, if you consent,
    to collect anonymous analytics data or show advertising.
</p>
<p>Cookies on QuickToolkit fall into two categories:</p>

<h3>2.1 Essential cookies</h3>
<p>
    These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be disabled via the cookie banner.
    They do not store information that identifies you personally.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Cookie consent preference</strong> – remembers whether you accepted or rejected
        optional cookies so that the banner is not shown on every visit.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>2.2 Optional cookies</h3>
<p>
    Optional cookies are only loaded if you click <em>“Accept”</em> on the cookie banner.
    If you choose <em>“Reject”</em>, these cookies are not set.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Analytics cookies (Google Analytics)</strong><br />
        Used to collect anonymous information about how visitors use the website.
        This helps improve the tools and general user experience.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Advertising cookies (Google AdSense, if enabled)</strong><br />
        Used to display adverts and measure their performance.
        If personalised advertising is enabled and you consent, these cookies may be used to show more relevant ads.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Optional cookies will <strong>not</strong> load unless you explicitly consent.</p>

<h2>3. Managing your cookie preferences</h2>
<p>
    On your first visit, you will see a cookie banner offering you the option to accept or reject optional cookies.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Accept</strong> – enables analytics and/or advertising cookies.</li>
    <li><strong>Reject</strong> – prevents optional cookies from loading.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    You can change your choice at any time by using the
    <a href="#" onclick="localStorage.removeItem('qt-cookie-consent'); location.reload();">
        Change cookie settings
    </a>
    link in the footer. This clears your previous decision and shows the banner again.
</p>

<h2>4. Third-party cookies</h2>
<p>
    Where optional cookies are enabled, third-party providers may also place cookies, including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Google Analytics</li>
    <li>Google AdSense (if advertising is enabled)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    For more information about how these providers handle data, please refer to their policies:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/cookies" target="_blank">Google Cookies</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Browser-level cookie controls</h2>
<p>
    Most browsers allow you to block or delete cookies.
    However, disabling cookies completely may affect how some websites function.
</p>
<p>
    Cookie settings can usually be found in your browser’s <em>Settings</em>,
    <em>Preferences</em> or <em>Privacy</em> menu.
</p>

<h2>6. Changes to this Cookie Policy</h2>
<p>
    We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time to reflect legal requirements or changes in how the website uses cookies.
    Any updates will appear on this page with a revised “Last updated” date.
